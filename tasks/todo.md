## DONE (merged to main 2026-06-14) — Containerized-gateway persistence (HERD_DATA_DIR)

Branch `feat/gateway-data-dir` off `main` (`e51d80e`). Independent of the scorer stack (PR #17) —
disjoint files (config.rs/server.rs/nodes/db.rs/analytics.rs/agent/audit.rs/Dockerfile), NO pool.rs/pool_sync.rs.

**Problem:** Dockerfile runs `herd` with `--home-dir /nonexistent`, so every `~/.herd` store is
non-writable/non-persistent → a containerized gateway loses fleet registry, analytics, costs, and
published binaries on restart.

### Store sites that root at `~/.herd` today (the full set the fix must cover)
1. `src/nodes/db.rs:62` — node registry SQLite `herd.db`
2. `src/analytics.rs:55` — analytics JSONL `requests.jsonl`
3. `src/agent/audit.rs:42` — agent audit JSONL `agent_audit.jsonl`
4. `src/server.rs:420` — agent session store dir `sessions/`
5. `src/server.rs:443` — frontier cost SQLite `frontier_costs.db`
6. `src/config.rs:744` — `publish_dir` **default** `~/.herd/binaries` (HERD_AGENT_PUBLISH_DIR override must KEEP precedence)
   - EXCLUDED (not Herd stores): `src/blob.rs:52` (`~/.ollama/models`, has OLLAMA_MODELS override), `src/updater.rs:68` (temp file in a passed-in dir).

### Plan (~10 lines)
1. **Resolver (config.rs):** add `data_dir_from(env, config) -> PathBuf` (env-injectable core, mirrors
   `publish_dir_from`): `HERD_DATA_DIR` env → config field → `dirs::home_dir().join(".herd")`. Default byte-identical to today.
2. **Config field:** top-level `Config.data_dir: Option<String>` (`#[serde(default)]`); `Config::resolved_data_dir()` wraps the core with the real env var.
3. **Single resolution point:** `server::run()` resolves the root once, threads a `&Path` into the store constructors.
4. **Thread it:** `NodeDb::open(&Path)`, `Analytics::new(&Path)`, `AgentAudit::new(&Path)` gain a data-root param (each joins its filename + `create_dir_all`); session_dir & `frontier_costs.db` (inline in server.rs) root under it; update the `#[cfg(test)]` AppState helper (~server.rs:2324) to pass a path.
5. **publish_dir default** re-rooted to `{data_dir}/binaries`; `HERD_AGENT_PUBLISH_DIR` and `fleet.publish_dir` still win.
6. **Startup creates** the data dir if absent (constructors already `create_dir_all`; add a top-level ensure so it's writable before any store opens).
7. **Dockerfile:** `mkdir -p /var/lib/herd && chown herd:herd`, `ENV HERD_DATA_DIR=/var/lib/herd`, `VOLUME /var/lib/herd` (keep `/nonexistent` home; HERD_DATA_DIR set explicitly so nothing falls back to home — documented).
8. **Docs:** `docker run`/compose snippet with the volume mount + a one-line README/skills note that a container gateway needs a persistent data volume.
9. **Tests:** default (no env/config) → every store under `~/.herd` unchanged; `HERD_DATA_DIR` set → all roots under it; `HERD_AGENT_PUBLISH_DIR` override still wins; data dir created when missing.
10. Gates: build + test (count grown) + clippy `-D warnings` + fmt `--check`. No unwrap/expect in lib code.

### Roles
ARCHITECT: confirm the resolver/threading design against the 6 sites (catch any store left scattered).
BUILDER: implement. REVIEWER (independent, blocking hunt list): (1) ALL 6 stores root under data dir — none left at `~/.herd`; (2) default byte-identical when unset; (3) data dir created + writable by non-root container user; (4) no unwrap/expect in lib. OPERATOR: gates, separate lib/total counts. LEAD: docs + PR, STOP at open PR (no auto-merge; independent outside review before merge).

### Status
- [x] STOP for go-ahead → approved
- [x] ARCHITECT confirm — 6 store KINDS correct, no 7th. Corrections: (1) `Analytics::new` 2nd caller server.rs:361;
  (2) out-of-crate tests `frontier_escalation.rs` + `fleet_routing.rs` call no-arg ctors → break build; (3) `frontier_costs.db`
  parent not self-created → single `create_dir_all` top of `run()`; (4) **`herd publish` CLI must honor HERD_DATA_DIR** (else
  binaries split from gateway); (5) `resolved_publish_dir` + `UpdateContext::from_config` thread data root; (6) `publish_dir_from`
  +3rd `data_root` param; (7) `BinaryStore::new` needs NO path (in-mem cache); (8) Dockerfile `ENV HERD_DATA_DIR` is the live delivery.
- [x] BUILDER implement — all 6 stores re-rooted via single resolution in `run()`; `data_dir_from`/`resolved_data_dir`;
  `publish_dir_from` +data_root; `herd publish` CLI honors HERD_DATA_DIR; Dockerfile ENV/VOLUME/chown; README Docker section.
  Callers fixed: server.rs:361 (prod Analytics), test helper, both out-of-crate tests. `frontier_escalation` NodeDb → in-memory.
- [x] OPERATOR gates — build ✓, clippy `-D warnings` ✓, fmt ✓; lib 459→**466** (+7), total 491→**498** (+7).
- [x] REVIEWER independent hunt list — CLEAN on all 8; no `~/.herd` residual in store paths, default byte-identical,
  CLI seam honored, no scorer collision, no `set_var` in tests, no unwrap in lib.
- [x] LEAD — committed (`6eb7726`) + opened **PR #18** vs main.
- [x] INDEPENDENT outside review (Opus) — **CLEAN-MERGEABLE** on all 6 hunt items (all stores route through the single
  resolver; default byte-identical by construction; no half-persist; precedence + CLI preserved; create-before-open; no lib unwrap;
  disjoint from #17). **Merged to main 2026-06-14** (`tasks/todo.md` doc conflict resolved on merge — code auto-merged clean).

## ACTIVE — Smart-routing scorer sprint (Phase 0 + Phase 1, two sequential PRs)

Foundation on `main` is `e51d80e` (#8 merge confirmed as tip). Full design lives in
`docs/specs/smart-routing-scorer-spec.md` (architect). 23-dimension / 4-phase rollout;
**this sprint ships Phase 0 + Phase 1 only**, phases 2–4 documented for later.

Baseline (on `main`, pre-sprint): lib **459** / total **491** (1 ignored). Build/clippy/fmt green.

Phases are SEQUENTIAL, **two separate PRs**. PR A (Phase 0) merges to main BEFORE PR B (Phase 1)
opens; PR B branches off updated main. **STOP at each open PR — no auto-merge.** Each PR also
gets an INDEPENDENT outside review (the in-session reviewer shares the builder's blind spots).

### Phase 0 (PR A) — telemetry to the pool boundary
Branch `feat/v1.2-scorer-pr-a-telemetry` off `main`.
- [x] ARCHITECT: wrote `docs/specs/smart-routing-scorer-spec.md` (full design, 23 dims / phases 0–4).
- [x] BUILDER: extended `BackendState` with the four `Option` fields (init `None` in `new()`/`add()`);
      `pool_sync.reconcile` populates queue_depth/ttft_p50_ms/vram_free_mb for `agent:` entries on BOTH
      add & update branches (add branch via new `set_agent_telemetry` setter); `max_concurrent` stays `None`.
      Routers untouched (`least_busy_cmp` tweak deliberately SKIPPED to keep "existing routers unchanged" literal).
- [x] Tests: +3 lib tests — new-agent carries fields (add branch), updated-agent refreshes (update branch),
      static/enrolled stay `None`. Anti-trivial (distinctive values: queue_depth 3/7, ttft 42/99, vram_free 30000/20000).
- [x] OPERATOR: gates green — build ✓, clippy `-D warnings` ✓, fmt ✓; lib 459→**462** (+3), total 491→**494** (+3).
- [x] REVIEWER: independent trace — CLEAN on all 7 hunt-list items, traced to file:line; router diff empty.
- [x] LEAD: committed (`46277b4`) + opened **PR #17** vs main. **STOPPED — no auto-merge; PR A awaits an INDEPENDENT outside review before merge. Phase 1 branches off main only AFTER #17 lands.**

### Phase 1 (PR B) — the Scored router — branch `feat/v1.2-scorer-pr-b-scored-router` off main (`c752121`, post-#17+#18)
**Status: BUILT + reviewed CLEAN — LEAD opening PR (STOP at open PR for outside review).** Baseline 501 → now **lib 498 / total 530** (+29 lib / +29 total over Phase-0 baseline 469/501).
Grounded in the hardened spec on `feat/scorer-spec-hardening` (Q6=(b) call-uniform-drop, B-1 name-uniqueness) — which must ride in (merge or land just before this PR).

**Impl-delta confirmations (architect, vs real code):**
- **#4 RouterEnum MUST override `route_scored`** (`router/mod.rs:41-56` impls only `route_excluding`). If left as trait-default, `RouterEnum::route_scored` delegates to `route_excluding` → `ScoredRouter::route_excluding` → `route_scored` with a DEFAULT ctx — so caller `ctx` (prompt_tokens) is silently dropped one level up; prompt-size dead forever. Fix: `RouterEnum` adds a `route_scored` match (Scored arm → real impl; 4 legacy arms inherit ctx-blind default) + a 5th `Scored` arm on `route_excluding`. **Highest-risk line.**
- **#8 name-uniqueness in `validate()`** (`config.rs:977` checks URLs only; `pool` is a `Vec`, no dedup) — determinism tie-break needs unique `name`. Fold into the backend loop: reserved `agent:`/`node:` prefix → warn+drop; duplicate static name → warn+keep-first (BTreeSet). Include in THIS PR (its tests need it).

**Builder task decomposition (ordered, each compiles+tests between):**
- [x] T1 — config types (`RoutingStrategy::Scored`+Display, `ModelGate`, `ScoredWeights`+default fns, `ScoredConfig`, `RoutingConfig.scored`) + `RouteContext` + defaulted `route_scored` trait method + `RouterEnum::Scored` + override (#4) + `create_router` arm (widen to take `&RoutingConfig`) + stub `scored.rs`.
- [x] T2 — `validate()` name-uniqueness (#8) → acceptance test #11.
- [x] T3 — `scored.rs` GATE (make `filter_healthy` `pub(crate)`; model-gate relaxed/strict; single snapshot; temp priority-select) → gate-before-score, 503-on-empty.
- [x] T4 — SCORE dims 1–9 (source map per spec) + Q6 call-uniform pre-pass (same `q()=round(x*1e6)` quantizer) + active-weight renorm + `denom==0→0.5` guard. Dims 10–23 read source→None→not-present (Phase 1 must NOT assume #17 telemetry populated). → right-backend, neutrality, Q6 (#12a).
- [x] T5 — SELECT i64 `score_q` total tie-break (score_q↓, priority↓, name↑) + `route_excluding`→`route_scored` terminal delegation → determinism (run-twice + shuffle-invariant), tie-break totality, all-identical fleet (#12b).
- [x] T6 — config sanitize: `unknown_weight_keys(&Mapping)` pure fn + warn (no `deny_unknown_fields`); negative/non-finite→default; all-Phase-1-dims-zero→default. → backward-compat (#9), Phase-2+ inertness (#10).
- [x] T7 — debug-log per-candidate breakdown (level-gated; surviving dims + `[dropped (call-uniform)]` + `[absent]` + denom).
- [x] T8 — reviewer pass + full suite green.
  - **Note:** T6's `sanitize_weights`/`unknown_weight_keys` were initially defined-but-UNWIRED (independent review caught it); wired into `validate()` (config.rs:1287) + `from_file` (config.rs:1147) and re-verified. LEAD re-ran gates: build/clippy `-D warnings`/fmt ✓, **lib 498 / total 530**, no unwrap in `scored.rs` lib.

**Call sites:** keep `route_excluding` drop-in for Phase 1 (proxy/retry/exclusion/503 unchanged); prompt-size (dim 3) stays dormant-neutral by construction (`Backend` has NO `max_context_len`; `ctx` unpopulated) — NOT a bug; call-site swap deferred. Note `openai.rs:359` + `server.rs:1437`.

**Risks flagged:** (1) hardened spec on separate branch must ride in (merge precondition); (2) `create_router` signature widen touches its 1 caller; (3) unknown-key diff needs raw-YAML mapping at load; (4) dim 3 doubly-dormant; (5) Phase-1 must not wire dim 5 to `vram_free_mb` (use gpu_metrics path) — the subtlest Phase-1/2 boundary.

- [x] **DIRECTOR GO-AHEAD** → BUILDER (T1–T8) ✓ → REVIEWER CLEAN ✓ → OPERATOR gates green ✓ → LEAD opening PR. **STOP at open PR — no auto-merge; independent outside review before merge.**

### Reviewer hunt list (any hit BLOCKS)
1. **DETERMINISM** — no RNG, no wall-clock in scoring path; fixed dimension iteration order; TOTAL tie-break
   (score desc → priority desc → name asc) so two backends never order ambiguously; same snapshot+request ⇒ identical route (asserted by test).
2. **MISSING-VALUE NEUTRALITY** — dimensions a static/enrolled backend can't report degrade to neutral 0.5, never penalize; assert static not disadvantaged vs agent.
3. **GATE-BEFORE-SCORE** — unhealthy/excluded/model-absent/circuit-open eliminated BEFORE scoring, not scored-to-zero.
4. **NO unwrap/expect in lib code** (test code may unwrap).

### Rules
conventional commits; commit trailer `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
Each phase: build + test (count grown) + clippy `-D warnings` + fmt --check green BEFORE its PR opens.

## PLANNED (awaiting go-ahead) — v1.2 PR #8: in-process fleet routing integration test

Branch `feat/v1.2-pr8-integration-test` off `main` (`5a97eab`, PRs #1–#7 landed). Closes the
v1.2 fleet foundation: proves the WHOLE chain in one process (heartbeat HTTP → registry →
reconcile → pool → router → proxy → upstream) — the assertion no unit test makes today.

### Plan (~10 lines)
1. **Test seam (minimal, `#[doc(hidden)] pub`, no behavior change):** `tests/` is an external
   crate and can only see `pub`. Expose: `NodeRegistry::with_clock`, the `test_clock` module
   (`TestClock::new/advance/as_fn`) + the `Clock` alias, and `AgentPoolSync::reconcile`.
   Prompt mandates "advance test_clock" + "one reconcile" — these are the seam.
2. `tests/fleet_routing.rs`, mirroring `agent_daemon.rs` (stub server) + `frontier_escalation.rs`
   (hand-built `AppState`). Helper builds: stub upstream (ephemeral port) recording received
   `/v1/chat/completions` hits; `AppState` with in-memory `NodeDb`, ModelAware router, a shared
   registry+pool; serves `heartbeat` + `chat_completions` on an ephemeral port = "the gateway".
   No `server::run` (avoids real port/home-dir touch — that stays the `#[ignore]`d two-box test).
3. **T1 happy path:** POST heartbeat advertising the stub → `reconcile` → POST chat to gateway →
   assert 200 AND stub.received == 1 AND body round-trips (anti-trivial: stub MUST have been hit).
4. **T2 drain→503:** register, reconcile (present), `clock.advance(TTL+1)`, reconcile (empty) →
   POST chat → assert **503** status code (no hidden fallback, a real error).
5. **T3 model routing:** two agents / two models, reconcile, request model X → only stub-X received.
6. Determinism = `TestClock` + explicit `reconcile`, never sleep+margin. No `unwrap/expect` in any
   lib code touched (test code may unwrap). Existing tests stay green.
7. **Gates:** `cargo build` + `cargo test` (report lib subtotal vs all-binaries total separately —
   they differ, not a drop) + `clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` + `fmt --check`.
8. **LEAD:** reconcile sprint doc (#8 ✅, v1.2 foundation complete) + ROADMAP; document the manual
   two-box acceptance in the PR body; open PR vs main. **STOP at the open PR — no auto-merge.**

### Roles
BUILDER: seam + `tests/fleet_routing.rs`. REVIEWER: independent pass — hunt list (any hit blocks):
(1) no wall-clock/margin timing; (2) anti-trivial — every test can FAIL (stub received assertion +
real 503); (3) no unwrap/expect in lib code touched. OPERATOR: gates, separate lib/total counts.
LEAD: docs + PR. Open PR then gets an INDEPENDENT review before merge.

### Rules
conventional commits; commit trailer
`Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

### Status
- [x] STOP for go-ahead → approved
- [x] Test seam (`#[doc(hidden)] pub`: `with_clock`/`Clock`, `reconcile`, `open_in_memory`)
- [x] tests/fleet_routing.rs (T1/T2/T3) — 3 tests green
- [x] Internal reviewer pass (hunt list) — CLEAN, no blocking findings, each test's failure mode traced
- [x] Gates green — build ✓, test 491 pass / 0 fail / 1 ignored (lib subtotal 459), clippy `-D warnings` ✓, fmt ✓
- [x] Docs reconciled (sprint #8 ✅ + v1.2 foundation complete; ROADMAP) + PR opened (no merge)
  - Open PR still gets an INDEPENDENT review before merge — internal pass is necessary, not sufficient.

## Backlog
- v1.1.1 / v1.1.2 not git-tagged (tags stop at v1.1.0); consider 1.2.0 bump + tags once #8 lands
  and the v1.2 foundation is complete.
